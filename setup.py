"""
## What the line package_dir={"": "src"} is doing ?

- This tells setuptools that the root directory of your packages is src/, 
    not the root of the project 

- By default, setuptools looks for packages in the same directory as setup.py. 

- But many developers prefer to keep their source code isolated in a folder like src/ to avoid issues.

### ðŸ§  How it works:

- The empty string "" refers to the current directory where setup.py is located.

- "src" says: when looking for packages relative to "", actually look in the src/ directory.

"""
## What the line packages=find_packages(where="src") is doing ?

- This automatically finds all Python packages (i.e., folders with an __init__.py file) 
  inside the src/ directory


### ðŸ§  How it works:

- find_packages(where="src") searches inside src/ for all valid Python packages and returns them as a list.

- It uses the __init__.py file to recognize a package.
