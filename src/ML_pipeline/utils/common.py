"""
What is ensure_annotations decorator ?

- It enforces type annotations in Python functions. 

- It checks if the arguments passed to a function and the return value match the specified type 
  annotations, raising an error if they don't. 

- Check if we have specified an function parameter as int then if other than int is given then it 
  will raise the error.
"""

"""
What we are doing here ?

- when we read any yaml file the output is in dict format.

- And in python dict we have to fetch the data form the dict like dict["key_name"]

- By using ConfigBox we can fetch the data from dict like dic.key_name

- ConfigBox return us an ConfigBox object.
